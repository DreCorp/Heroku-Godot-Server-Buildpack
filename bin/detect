# As per Heroku Buildpack Api 2022
# This script takes BUILD_DIR as a single argument and must return an exit code of 0
# if the app present at BUILD_DIR can be serviced by this buildpack
# If the exit code is 0, the script must print a human-readable framework name to stdout

# Check if project.godot exists in the repo
